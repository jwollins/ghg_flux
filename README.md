## Soil Greenhouse Gas Flux Calculation (R Scripts)
This repository contains R scripts for calculating soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, including CO‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ, and N‚ÇÇO emissions. The scripts are currently work-in-progress and have not been fully streamlined into a package or workflow. However, they may still be useful for processing, visualizing, and analyzing GHG flux data from soil experiments.

üöß Status: Work in Progress
‚ö†Ô∏è These scripts are currently messy and not fully integrated into a single pipeline. They may require manual adjustments depending on your dataset and objectives. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome!
